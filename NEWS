Changes in Version 1.3-1

  o new plotting argument 'storepop' which displays intermediate population locations.


Changes in Version 1.3-0

  o the function 'DEoptim' has two arguments: 'storepopfrom' and 'storepopfreq', for tracking intermediate
    populations; the output contains also the list 'storepop' which belongs to the 'member' list's element.

  o small bug fixed for the number of iterations.


Changes in Version 1.2-1

  o fix a bug in the optimization procedure.

  o add a demo to show how to increase the number of printed digits while performing the optimization.


Changes in Version 1.2-0

  o the function 'DEoptim' has the new argument 'initial', which is an initial or starting population.
    You can therefore introduce a starting population in the optimization procedure. This can be useful
    when the optimization has to be run many times on data sets which differ sligthly.

  o the function 'DEoptim' outputs now 'pop' in the 'member' list's element. This is the population obtained
    at the last iteration which can be used as a starting population in 'DEoptim' via the argument 'initial'.

  o the function stops if any 'NA' or 'NaN' value is returned by the function 'FUN' to be optimized.

  o the function DEoptim does not handle exponential crossover anymore. This is so to simplify and
    accelerate the optimization procedure.

  o the function 'DEoptim' outputs a list of lists. This is more natural and in the same spirit
    of usual optimization functions.

  o documentation for the 'digits'.
